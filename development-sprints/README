Contained herein are source documents for the 5 software sprints that were run over the summer of 2025 during the Data Science Fellowship at University of California Riverside.
Joshua Zingale led six undergraduate students to develop an AI Tutor. The names of the six undergraduate students have been replaced with "Student #1-6".


To compile the sprints, you must have `pandoc` installed and have the executable in your PATH with the name "pandoc".
With `pandoc` installed, you may run `compile.bash` to compile the report.
