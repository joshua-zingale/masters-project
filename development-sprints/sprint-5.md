**State:** File uploading, chatting, and user authentication

**Objective:** Deployable web server with reduced feature set

**Future:** Bug fixes, polishing, and final presentation preparation

**Introduction**

The end is nigh. We must present our final product by next Wednesday the
13th. Our application is not yet in a usable state. Therefore, our
primary goal is to get our application into a usable state.

The major problem is that the chatbot currently responds with dummy
text. This instead should respond with an RAG-powered, LLM-generated
response.

Additionally, we need some styling added to the web pages that currently
lack styling.

Pending a report on the progress of the human-in-the-chat feature, there
may be work to accomplish here.

**Assignments**

The assignments for this week are GitHub issues. Go to the [[issues
tab]{.underline}](https://github.com/joshua-zingale/ucr-chatbot-pathway-program/issues)
of our GitHub repository and submit one or more pull requests to address
any and all issues assigned to you.
