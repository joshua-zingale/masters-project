Herein lies the documentational portion of my master's project at University of California, Riverside (UCR).

The project was to develop an AI Tutor, designed to record data on student usage for future research analysis, and to deploy it in courses at UCR.
The AI Tutor itself is a flask-based web-server that resides in a separate repository, which can be found [here](https://github.com/joshua-zingale/ucr-chatbot-pathway-program).
Its development was initiated under my (Joshua Zingale's) management by six undergraduate students during the first half of the summer, 2025;
then I saw the system to its finish, including the addition of needed features, the closing of security vulnerabilities, the acquisition of Internal Review Board and Information Technology Systems approval, the deployment of the web service though Google Cloud Platform, and the introduction of the AI Tutor into three courses for the Fall 2025 Academic Quarter: the tutor was deployed in two sections of CS100 (Software Technology) and one section of CS166 (Database Management Systems), both being undergraduate courses.
