title: The Development and Introduction in Computer-Science Courses of an AI Tutor
author: Joshua Zingale
abstract: "Teaching with general-purpose generative AI as an aid poses multiple challenges to educators: for instance, providing false information, teaching out-of-scope concepts, and giving full assignment answers to students all lower the degree of confidence with which generative AI may be deployed. We therefore present a prototype AI Tutor. This report covers the AI Tutor's development and deployment in three computer-science courses, from which we collect data to inform future research diretections."

# Introduction

Aligning general-purpose generative AI to me domain specific needs is an active area of research and development in both academia and industry.
